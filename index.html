    <h2>description</h2>
      <p>
      I build digital products for software firms. I have a background in coding and software architecture but also know the design process and the methodologies that lead to successful startup businesses.
      </p>

      <p>
      I know how to conduct research and how to find the right problem to solve. I know how to explore an opportunity and find value for the customer. I know the techniques to test risks, assumptions, and prototypes against the market. And finally, I&rsquo;m an experienced developer who can build MVPs, ship the first version, and plan a scalable tech stack.
      </p>

      <p>
      I believe in cross-disciplinary teams, close collaboration, and rapid iteration. I love being around smart people but can also lead or consult on a project myself. Whatever you&rsquo;re up to, <a href="#contact">get in touch</a>; I like coffees and drinks and I tolerate Skype.
      </p>

    <h2>Recent work</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>The self starter:</dt> <dd>A year long business venture creating customized products and developing a customer base. Myself and my business partner took a year off to start our own business. I managed not only employees but myself as well. Made contacts and develop partnerships with other companies. We specialized in custom B2B applicstions almost exclusively on the web. Solving business problems with great tools that fit perfectly. The most I got out of this was the sales experience. Sitting down and pitching our idea and convincing the people across from me that our way was the best way.</dd>
        <dt>The project factory:</dt> <dd>A year and a half working for a firm in Seattle where I was glad to earn responsibility I never had before. I started at the bottom as a Junhior Engineer and quickly worked my way into a great leading position. This company had the best opportunities in their projects. I got to work with a Multi million dollar international company developing a front end highly interactive experience. I was also able to assist with a Facebook application that worked with many companies with groundbreaking engineering in search and heuristics. One of the side projects the owner offered me was coming in on Saturdays and teaching the interns. This was very enjoyable and rewarding.  </dd>

        <dt>The class room:</dt> <dd>For two years I worked a state university in Florida involved in a medical meets technology project. This was a very different environment I was used to. I had to work with doctors and other medical personnel and so I had to learn to translate the tech speak so that they understood what needed to be done. The biggest hurdle was conforming to HIPPAA laws so that all the personal data was highly secure, more so than usual. This went as far as developing an application that can only be accessed through the school's VPN. This was due to the paranoia of letting their data being accessible on the internet. It was a small tech team and I was the most experinced so I was glad to take charge and teach others. </dd>
         <dt>The foot in the door:</dt> <dd>For nearly a year I worked hand in hand with the owner of a web development firm. This was the first time I was introduced to Vim, my editor of choice. This was a great envirnment, we would work in the same room side by side and he was there for any questions I had and boy I was always curious. I learned a lot by his hand and I am thankful he took a chance on me. I worked on two projects, one a internal application for health insurance companies to manage clients and many other things. The other was working onsite of a telemarketing company creating a system for making calls via a web interface using asterisk in the backend with PHP and some Python for systems related work. </dd>

    <h2>personal projects</h2>
    <p> Github: <a href="https://github.com/jkrobles">https://github.com/jkrobles</a><br>
        I wrote a daemon IRC service that extends the functionality of Anope Services. This service was created in only PHP and pulled the data from Anope's database. This daemon was tested and optimized so well it barely had any mark on the resources with very low latency. 
        I used to run IRC networks that hosted many open source projects and podcasts, such as Diggnation, Geekdrome and Geekcast.
